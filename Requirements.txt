Memberships
* User should see link for Basic plan on home page.

Stripe integration
* Users should have a stripe costumer token in the users table.
* JavaScript should prevent Pro form from submitting, when user fills it out,
and should send card info to stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
* JavaScript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app
should validate the user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token
to stripe server and stripe will create a subscription and send back costumer
token. Rails should save costumer token and user information to our database.
